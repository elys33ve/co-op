These are all just simple python scripts to test PyQt5 and get kinda aquainted
with some of it's tools. I may end up having to use C or C++ instead so that
it's faster but the goal was just to test how i'd want a simple interface to
test some things on another device.

keypad_qt.py is similar to how i'd want a keypad test to work (the second keypad
is just for testing how it would work because it's not connected to the device
keypad).

most of the other scripts are just from testing some of the classes and
functions and getting familiar with how they work.
